## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
##  Prerequisites
1. NetBeans Installation
2. Create a Project File in beans
4. Button Configuration
## Installing
## Netbeans Installation
NetBeans IDE is a Free open-Source, Cross-plate form Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It can run any machine which consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It consists of many features for application development as follows:-

Step 1: You need to have a setup file of the NetBeans JAVA into your setup.

step 2: You can download any type of setup as per your requirements.

Step 3. Right-click on the setup or you can Double-Click on the setup by using the mouse.

Step 4.Click on the next option


### Create a project File in Netbeans
Start the newbeans IDE

1.Click on File then new project after that java and then on java application.

File->new project->java->java application

## Electricty Billing System Usage

TEXT-FIELDS:-In this project there are three main text fields.First one is customer id in which we have to fill customer id.Second one is for customer name ,in this text field we have to fill customer name.And the third one is for unit in this we have to fill unit which is consumed by the customers.
